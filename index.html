        <h2>Rivers</h2>
        <p>The Himalayas are also an important source of fresh water for the countries surrounding it. The rivers that originate from the Himalayas, such as the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Indus, provide water for irrigation and hydroelectric power for millions of people. However, the rapid melting of the Himalayan glaciers due to climate change poses a significant threat to the fresh water supply for the region, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in the area.
